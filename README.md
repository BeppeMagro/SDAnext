### 📥 Standalone Executable for Windows (No MATLAB Required)

If you do **not** have MATLAB installed:

1.  🛠️ **Install MATLAB Runtime** (required only once):
    -   🌐 [Download MATLAB Runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html) **R2023a** from MathWorks:
        -   🔑 You'll need **administrator rights** for installation.
2.  📦 **Download SDAnext Executable**
    -   🔹 **Option A – GitHub Releases section (recommended)**
        - Precompiled versions of SDAnext are available under the Releases section on GitHub.
        - Each release corresponds to a specific software version.
        - The Windows executable `SDAnext_vX.Y.exe` is directly visible and downloadable.
        - In this case, simply download the `.exe` file.
    -   🔹 **Option B – GitHub Code page**
        1. Go to the main GitHub repository page.
        2. Click the green **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**.
        3. Extract the ZIP archive to your preferred location.
        4. Navigate to the `build` directory and open the most recent subfolder named `YYYY-MM-DD-<index>` (these names reflect the **date and sequence number** of each build) and find the `.exe` file.

💡 *Tip: Once you've found the executable, you can **copy `SDAnext_vX.Y.exe` anywhere** on your computer (e.g., Desktop, Documents, etc.). You may also delete the rest of the downloaded files if you no longer need them.*

🚀 **Launch the application by double-clicking `SDAnext_vX.Y.exe`.**
> 🚫 *macOS and Linux users cannot currently run SDAnext as a standalone application, as no platform-specific executables are available.*

### 🧩 About MATLAB Runtime

To run the application, **MATLAB Runtime (R2023a)** must be installed **only once** on your system.

- If it's already installed, **you don’t need to install it again**.
- If you re-download a new version of SDAnext compiled with a different MATLAB version in the future, you'll need the **matching version** of the Runtime.

📄 In that case, refer to the specific `readme.txt` file found in the corresponding `build/YYYY-MM-DD-*` folder for updated instructions.

### ⚙ Running from MATLAB (For Developers)

1.  📂 Open MATLAB and navigate to the `SDAnext` folder:
    ```matlab
    cd path_to_SDAnext
    ```
2.  🚀 Launch the app:
    -   🎨 Open `SDAnext.mlapp` in App Designer and **click Run**.
    -   ⌨️ Or execute in the MATLAB command window:
        ```matlab
        app = SDAnext;
        ```

## 🔎 Input File Format

Plain text input files must contain:

* **Dose (Gy)**
* **Survival Fraction** (0–1)
* Optional: **Standard Deviation** (used for weighting)

📌 Metadata lines start with `!` and support:

* `Title`
* `DisplayName`
* `Color`

💬 Comment lines starting with `#` are ignored and may appear anywhere.

**Example:**

```
!Title='Radiation Dose Response Data'
!DisplayName='Sample Curve A'
!Color='Blue'
1.0 0.90 0.05
2.0 0.80 0.05
3.0 0.70 0.04
4.0 0.60 0.03
```

➕ If a data point at **dose = 0** and **SF = 1** is missing, it is added automatically.
📐 Data are sorted by ascending dose before fitting.

## 💡 Basic Workflow

SDAnext is organized around two main tabs, corresponding to two complementary analysis stages: **Fitter** and **Viewer**.

### 🔬 Fitter Tab – Survival Curve Fitting

The **Fitter** tab is dedicated to loading experimental data, fitting survival models, and inspecting fit quality and parameters.

**Typical workflow:**

1. 📂 **Load experimental data**
   - Load one or more datasets using the **Data Loader** panel (`.txt` or `.mat`). Data are automatically validated and preprocessed.

2. 🧮 **Select a survival model**
   - Choose among the available models:
     * Linear (L)
     * Quadratic (Q)
     * Linear–Quadratic (LQ)
     * Linear–Quadratic–Cubic (LQC)
     * Linear–Quadratic–Linear (LQL)

3. ⚙️ **Configure fit options**
   - Adjust bounds, initial guesses, weighting options, and confidence interval settings as needed.

4. ▶️ **Run the fit**
   - Click **Fit Data** to perform the curve fitting. When experimental standard deviations are provided, weighted least squares are applied automatically.

5. 📊 **Inspect results**

   * View fitted curves overlaid on experimental data
   * Inspect fitted parameters and uncertainties
   * Examine goodness-of-fit metrics (RMSE, adjusted R-square, normalized SSE)

6. 🔍 **Model scanning (optional)**
   - Use the **Scan available models** function to automatically test all supported models and compare only those that successfully converge and yield statistically meaningful results.

7. 🔁 **Bidirectional interpolation (optional)**
   - Use the **Interpolator** tool to compute:
     * Dose → Survival Fraction
     * Survival Fraction → Isoeffective Dose

### 📈 Viewer Tab – Multi-session Analysis and RBE

The **Viewer** tab is designed for comparative analyses across multiple datasets and fitted models, including RBE evaluation.

**Typical workflow:**

1. 📥 **Load a session file**
   - Import one or more previously fitted sessions (`.mat` files) generated in the Fitter tab.
2. 🧬 **Manage multiple datasets**
   - Overlay multiple experimental curves and fitted models in a single plot. Styling options allow customization of colors, markers, and line styles.
3. 🎯 **Select the reference model**
   - Explicitly choose the reference curve using the dedicated drop-down menu. The selected reference defines the baseline for RBE calculations.
4. 🧮 **Compute RBE**
   - Trigger RBE computation using the **Compute RBE** control. Two evaluation modes are supported:
      * **Survival-fraction–based RBE:** RBE at fixed SF values
      * **Dose-based RBE:** RBE at fixed reference doses (e.g. 2 Gy)
5. 💾 **Export results**
   - Export RBE tables and related quantities in a structured text format for downstream statistical or clinical analyses.

## 🔬 Scientific Background

SDAnext implements survival models commonly used in radiation biology, based on the linear-quadratic model:

$SF = e^{-\alpha D - \beta D^2}$

where:

$D$ = Radiation dose (Gy)
$SF$ = Survival fraction
$\alpha$, $\beta$ = Model parameters

Other supported models extend this equation with cubic or dose threshold-based corrections.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**🔴 Application does not start?**

-   ✔️ Ensure that MATLAB Runtime (R2023a) is installed.
-   ✔️ Try running the application as an administrator.

**🟠 MATLAB Runtime is missing or incorrect version?**

-   ✔️ Uninstall any older versions and reinstall MATLAB Runtime R2023a.
-   ✔️ Check your installation using this command in the terminal:

    ```sh
    matlab -batch "ver"
    ```

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

To uninstall SDAnext, simply delete the installation folder. To remove MATLAB Runtime, use the Control Panel (Windows) or the system’s package manager (macOS/Linux).
